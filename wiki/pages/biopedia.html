Early farmers selected the best-looking plants and seeds and saved them to plant for the next season. Then, once the science of genetics became better understood, plant breeders used what they knew about the genes of a plant to select for specific desirable traits to develop improved varieties.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Context and Importance</strong>: The global population is projected to surpass 9 billion by 2050, leading to an estimated 100-110% increase in the demand for crops compared to 2005. To meet the food requirements of this rapidly growing population, especially in the context of uncertain climate change and diminishing arable land, it is essential to enhance food production while reducing inputs. Traditional plant breeding methods are often labor-intensive and time-consuming, whereas genetic engineering offers a promising approach to boost crop productivity.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Nuclear Genome Transformation</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Introduction</strong>: Nuclear genome transformation has become a widely adopted technique in many economically important plant species. However, it comes with several limitations, such as unpredictable expression of the gene of interest and gene silencing due to the random integration of T-DNA.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Alternative Approaches</strong>: In addition to nuclear transformation, plants provide another avenue for genetic modification through the transformation of the small genomes of two DNA-containing cell organelles: plastids (chloroplasts) and mitochondria, which are derived from cyanobacteria and α-proteobacteria, respectively.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Advantages of Plastid Transformation</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Highly Precise Transgene Insertion</strong>: Efficient homologous recombination allows for precise and targeted insertion of transgenes into the plastid genome.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>High Levels of Protein Expression</strong>: The potential for expressing foreign proteins at extremely high levels, up to 75% of the total soluble protein, makes plastid transformation highly attractive for producing recombinant proteins.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Multigene Engineering</strong>: The ability to stack multiple transgenes in synthetic operons in a single transformation event facilitates the engineering of complex traits.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Absence of Epigenetic Effects</strong>: Plastid transformation avoids issues such as gene silencing and position effects, which are common in nuclear transformation.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Increased Biosafety</strong>: Since plastids are generally not transmitted through pollen in most crops, there is a reduced risk of transgene spread, enhancing biosafety.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Applications of Plastid Transformation</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Production of Recombinant Proteins and Enzymes</strong>: Plastids can be used to produce pharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Resistance to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses</strong>: Enhanced resistance against insect pests, viral, fungal, and bacterial diseases, as well as tolerance to abiotic stresses like salt, drought, and cold.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Herbicide Resistance</strong>: Improved resistance to herbicides, facilitating weed management.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Historical Development and Current Status</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>First Successes</strong>: The first successful plastid transformation was achieved in <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em>, a unicellular green alga, followed by <em>Nicotiana tabacum</em> (tobacco), a dicotyledonous flowering plant.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Expansion to Other Species</strong>: Since then, plastid transformation technology has been extended to over 20 species of flowering plants. Reproducible protocols for achieving homoplastic offspring are currently limited to a few species, including tobacco, potato, tomato, cabbage, soybean, lettuce, poplar, and licorice weed.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Challenges with Cereals</strong>: Cereals, the world's most important food crops, have proven to be recalcitrant to chloroplast transformation. This is primarily due to the lack of suitable selectable systems, low shoot regeneration frequencies, and the absence of effective cis-elements for transgene expression in non-green plastids.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Recent Advances</strong>: A high-efficiency plastid transformation protocol for the model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> has been developed, relying on a root-based selection and regeneration system, along with the use of <em>acc2</em> knockout lines, which significantly enhances the efficiency of plastid transformation.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Stable Plastid Transformation in Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis)</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Introduction</strong>: Kiwifruit is a valuable crop with a high content of vitamin C and other beneficial metabolites.

Both cassettes are flanked by kiwifruit-specific sequences to allow targeted insertion into the plastid genome between the <em>trnfM</em> and <em>trnG</em> genes.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Biolistic DNA Delivery and Selection of Transplastomic Plants</strong>: Leaf explants were bombarded with the pQQC7 plasmid using optimized parameters. Primary spectinomycin-resistant calli appeared after three months, and six independent transplastomic lines were obtained from 12 plates. These lines were further propagated and regenerated to achieve homoplasmy, and then transferred to soil.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Results</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Optimization of Plant Regeneration and Selection System for Kiwifruit</strong>: Different hormone combinations were tested, and AcReM3 was found to be the most effective for inducing shoots from young leaf explants.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Selection of Plastid-Transformed Kiwifruit</strong>: The use of 300 mg L-1 spectinomycin was effective for selecting plastid-transformed kiwifruit, resulting in the establishment of stable transplastomic lines.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Backcrossing</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Backcrossing is a breeding method where a hybrid offspring is crossed back to one of its parents, often the parent that has the desired trait. This process is repeated over several generations to introduce a specific trait from the donor parent into the genetic background of the recurrent parent.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: It is commonly used in plant breeding to incorporate a single gene or a few genes controlling a desirable trait, such as disease resistance, into an otherwise well-adapted variety.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS)</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Marker-assisted selection involves using molecular markers linked to traits of interest to select individuals for breeding. These markers can be DNA sequences that are associated with the expression of a particular phenotype.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: MAS allows breeders to identify and select plants carrying the desired traits at an early stage, without having to wait for the trait to be expressed, thus accelerating the breeding process.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Genome Editing</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Genome editing refers to a set of technologies that enable scientists to change an organism's DNA by adding, removing, or altering genetic material at particular locations in the genome.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: Techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 have revolutionized the field, allowing for precise modifications to plant genomes, which can lead to improved crop varieties with enhanced characteristics.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Cisgenesis</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Cisgenesis is a form of genetic engineering where only genes from the same species or closely related species are transferred. This approach aims to mimic traditional breeding but with the precision and speed of genetic engineering.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: Cisgenic crops are designed to address consumer concerns about transgenic (GMO) crops, as they contain no foreign DNA and may be more acceptable to the public.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Transgenesis</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Transgenesis is the process of introducing foreign DNA (transgenes) into an organism, resulting in the stable inheritance of the introduced genetic material.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: In agriculture, transgenic plants (often called GMOs) are developed to exhibit traits such as herbicide tolerance, pest resistance, or enhanced nutritional value.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>T-DNA (Transfer DNA)</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: T-DNA is a segment of DNA that is transferred from Agrobacterium tumefaciens to the plant cell during the natural infection process. In genetic engineering, it is used as a vector to deliver the desired gene(s) into the plant genome.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: The T-DNA region of a binary vector is engineered to include the gene of interest along with regulatory elements to ensure proper expression in the host plant.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Selectable Markers</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Selectable markers are genes that confer a trait that can be easily identified, usually antibiotic or herbicide resistance, which allows for the selection of transformed cells or organisms.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: In genetic engineering, selectable markers help researchers to distinguish between successfully transformed cells and those that have not taken up the new genetic material.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Reporter Genes</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Reporter genes are used to study the regulation and function of other genes. They encode proteins that produce a measurable signal, such as fluorescence or luminescence, when expressed.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: Common reporter genes include green fluorescent protein (GFP), β-glucuronidase (GUS), and luciferase. They are often included in transformation vectors to track the expression of the gene of interest.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Homologous Recombination (HR)</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Homologous recombination is a type of genetic recombination in which nucleotide sequences are exchanged between two similar or identical molecules of DNA.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: In plastid transformation, HR is exploited to insert transgenes precisely into the plastid genome, avoiding random integration and potential disruption of endogenous genes.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Gene Silencing</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Gene silencing is the process by which the expression of a gene is reduced or completely suppressed. It can occur through various mechanisms, including RNA interference (RNAi) and transcriptional gene silencing.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: Gene silencing is a concern in nuclear transformation because the random integration of T-DNA can lead to the inactivation of the introduced gene. Plastid transformation avoids this issue due to the absence of epigenetic effects.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Transformation Efficiency</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Transformation efficiency refers to the proportion of cells that successfully take up and integrate the exogenous DNA.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: High transformation efficiency is desirable in genetic engineering to minimize the amount of work and resources needed to generate and screen transformants.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Biomass Production</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Biomass production refers to the total mass of living biological organisms in a given area or volume at a given time.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: Increasing biomass production is a goal in many agricultural and bioenergy applications, as it can lead to higher yields of food, feed, or raw materials for energy production.</li></ul><p style="text-align: start;"><strong>Sustainable Agriculture</strong></p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Definition</strong>: Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways, meeting society's present food and textile needs, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Usage</strong>: Genetic engineering and advanced plant breeding techniques play a role in sustainable agriculture by developing crops that require fewer inputs, such as water and pesticides, while maintaining or increasing yields.</li></ul><h2><a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/hubu-china/description" target="_blank">Description</a></h2><ul><li style="text-align: start;">Agricultural Productivity: The measure of the efficiency and effectiveness with which agricultural inputs (such as land, labor, capital, and technology) are used to produce agricultural outputs. It is often expressed in terms of yield per unit area or per unit of input. Agricultural productivity can be affected by a range of factors, including climate, soil quality, farming practices, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Environmental Stimuli: External factors that can cause a response or change in an organism's behavior or physiology. These stimuli can include abiotic factors such as temperature, light, water, and atmospheric gases, as well as biotic factors like interactions with other organisms, including predators, competitors, and pathogens. In agriculture, environmental stimuli can affect plant growth, development, and crop yields, as well as the activity and survival of pests and beneficial organisms.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Pests and Pathogens: Organisms that can cause damage or disease to plants, animals, or humans. Pests typically refer to insects, mites, nematodes, and other animals that feed on crops or stored products, while pathogens are microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and oomycetes, that cause diseases. Both can significantly reduce agricultural productivity and have economic, social, and ecological impacts.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO): A specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger and improve nutrition and food security. The FAO provides technical assistance, policy advice, and knowledge exchange to help countries make informed decisions about agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and rural development. It also monitors global food supplies and works to prevent and mitigate food crises.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Chemical Insecticides: Substances designed to kill, repel, or control insect populations. They may act through various mechanisms, such as disrupting the nervous system, inhibiting growth, or preventing reproduction. Chemical insecticides have been widely used in agriculture for pest control, but their overuse has led to issues such as resistance, environmental contamination, and negative effects on non-target organisms, including pollinators and natural enemies of pests.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Resistance to Insecticides: The ability of an insect population to survive and reproduce after exposure to a pesticide that would normally be lethal. Resistance develops due to genetic changes within the population, often as a result of selection pressure from repeated applications of the same or similar chemicals. Over time, the resistant individuals become more common, leading to a decrease in the efficacy of the pesticide.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Lepidoptera: An order of insects that includes butterflies and moths. Lepidopterans are characterized by large, scale-covered wings, a coiled proboscis for feeding, and a complete metamorphosis life cycle. Many species are important pollinators, but some, particularly certain moth larvae, are significant agricultural pests.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Spodoptera litura: Also known as the tobacco cutworm or cluster caterpillar, S. litura is a polyphagous pest that attacks a wide variety of crops across Asia, Africa, and Oceania. The larvae can cause extensive damage by defoliating plants, and they are difficult to control due to their rapid development and the emergence of resistance to conventional pesticides.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Synthetic Biology: An interdisciplinary branch of biology and engineering that involves the design and construction of new biological parts, devices, and systems, as well as the redesign of existing, natural biological systems for useful purposes. Synthetic biology combines elements from molecular biology, genetics, biotechnology, and bioinformatics, with the goal of creating novel biological functions and solving complex problems in areas such as medicine, energy, and the environment.</li><li style="text-align: start;">RNA Interference (RNAi): A cellular mechanism by which small RNA molecules, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs), silence gene expression. This process can occur at the transcriptional level, where it affects DNA methylation and chromatin structure, or at the post-transcriptional level, where it leads to the degradation of mRNA or blocks its translation into proteins. RNAi is a powerful tool for studying gene function and has potential applications in pest control, therapy, and functional genomics.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Chitin Synthase (CHS1): An enzyme that catalyzes the polymerization of N-acetylglucosamine units to form chitin, a long-chain polysaccharide that is a major component of the exoskeleton in arthropods, including insects, and the cell walls of fungi.

This property makes TAT47-57 a valuable tool for developing drug delivery systems.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Virus-Like Particles (VLPs): Non-infectious, self-assembling particles that resemble viruses but lack viral genetic material. VLPs are composed of one or more viral structural proteins and can be used to deliver vaccines, therapeutic agents, or genetic material. They are considered safer than live or attenuated viruses because they cannot replicate, and they can induce strong immune responses, making them useful in vaccine development and gene therapy.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Plastid Engineering: The genetic modification of plastids, such as chloroplasts, which are organelles found in plant cells responsible for photosynthesis. Plastid engineering allows for the introduction of foreign genes into the plastid genome, resulting in high-level expression of the introduced genes, stable inheritance, and the potential for enhanced biosafety, since plastid genomes are generally not transferred through pollen.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Transplastomic Plants: Plants that have been genetically modified by introducing foreign DNA into their plastid genomes. Transplastomic plants can express the introduced genes at very high levels, and the genetic modifications are usually maternally inherited, reducing the risk of gene flow to wild relatives. This approach can be used to confer traits such as herbicide tolerance, pathogen resistance, or the production of pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Epigenetic Effects: Changes in gene function that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling, can influence how genes are expressed. In the context of genetic engineering, epigenetic effects can lead to unintended silencing or activation of genes, which may affect the stability and predictability of the engineered traits.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Biosafety: The application of measures to ensure the safe handling, storage, transport, and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) and their products. Biosafety aims to minimize the potential risks to human health and the environment, including the spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to non-target areas, the creation of superweeds, and the unintended consequences of gene transfer. Regulations and guidelines for biosafety vary by country and are designed to assess and manage the risks associated with GMOs.</li><li style="text-align: start;">siRNA (small interfering RNA): Short, double-stranded RNA molecules, typically 20-25 base pairs in length, that are involved in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. siRNAs can be generated from longer dsRNA precursors and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to cleave or repress the expression of complementary mRNA, thereby silencing the target gene. siRNAs are used in research and have therapeutic potential for treating diseases caused by aberrant gene expression.</li></ul><h2><a href="https://2024.igem.wiki/hubu-china/design" target="_blank">Design</a></h2><ul><li style="text-align: start;">Plastid Plastids are a group of organelles found in plant and algal cells. They are involved in the synthesis and storage of food, as well as in the production of pigments. The most well-known plastid is the chloroplast, which is responsible for photosynthesis, converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. Other types of plastids include chromoplasts, which store pigments such as carotenoids, and leucoplasts, which store starch, lipids, and proteins. Plastids have their own DNA, known as the plastome, and they can replicate independently of the cell's nucleus.</li><li style="text-align: start;">RNAi (RNA Interference) RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which RNA molecules inhibit gene expression, typically by causing the destruction of specific mRNA (messenger RNA) molecules. This process is used by cells to regulate gene activity and defend against viruses. In research and biotechnology, RNAi has become a powerful tool for studying the function of genes and developing potential therapeutic agents. It involves the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs) that target complementary mRNA sequences, leading to their degradation or blocking translation, thus preventing the production of the corresponding protein.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Tobacco is an annual herbaceous plant, widely cultivated for its leaves, which contain nicotine, a potent alkaloid. The species Nicotiana tabacum is the primary source of commercial tobacco. While it is best known for its use in smoking products, such as cigarettes and cigars, tobacco is also a model organism in plant biology due to its ease of genetic manipulation and transformation. In biotechnological applications, tobacco plants can be engineered to produce pharmaceuticals, enzymes, and other valuable compounds.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Pollen Pollen is a fine, powdery substance consisting of microscopic grains (pollen grains) that are produced by the male parts of seed plants, specifically the anthers of angiosperms (flowering plants) and the microsporangia of gymnosperms (cone-bearing plants). Each pollen grain contains the male gametophyte, which includes the male reproductive cells necessary for fertilization. Pollen plays a critical role in the sexual reproduction of plants, and it is dispersed by various means, including wind, water, and animals, to reach the female part of the flower (the stigma) where it can germinate and initiate the formation of a pollen tube, leading to fertilization.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Backbone (in Genetic Engineering) In genetic engineering, a backbone refers to the core structure of a vector, such as a plasmid, viral vector, or bacteriophage, into which foreign DNA fragments can be inserted. The backbone provides essential elements for the propagation and maintenance of the construct within host cells, including origin of replication (ori), antibiotic resistance genes for selection, and sometimes regulatory elements. By selecting appropriate backbones, researchers can control the expression of the inserted genes and ensure that the genetic material is stably inherited during cell division.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Chitin Chitin is a long-chain polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, a derivative of glucose. It is a structural polysaccharide that forms a key component of the exoskeletons of arthropods, such as insects, crustaceans, and arachnids, as well as the cell walls of fungi. Chitin is second only to cellulose in abundance among naturally occurring organic polymers. Its properties, such as strength, flexibility, and resistance to many chemicals, make it an important material in nature. In biotechnology, chitin and its derivatives, like chitosan, have various applications, including in wound healing, drug delivery, and water treatment.</li><li style="text-align: start;">Chitin Synthase (CHS) Chitin synthase is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of chitin from its monomer, N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). This enzyme is crucial for the development and maintenance of the exoskeleton in arthropods and the cell walls in fungi. There are multiple isoforms of chitin synthase, each with specific roles in different stages of development and in response to environmental conditions. In pest management, chitin synthase is a target for the development of insecticides, as inhibiting this enzyme can disrupt the growth and survival of pests.</li></ul><h2 style="text-align: start;">Contribution</h2><ul><li style="text-align: start;">Enriching the Part Registry Enriching the Part Registry refers to the process of adding new and useful genetic parts and devices to a database, such as the iGEM Parts Registry.
