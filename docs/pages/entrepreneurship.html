Therefore, HUBU-China team also attempted to produce RNA interference (RNAi) pesticide using gut bacteria of insects. This pesticide could kill coleopteran insects as quickly as 4 days and be degraded naturally in soil and water in 10–14 days. </span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">To commercialize our project, we designed a complete business plan. In order to have a greater impact on the world, as part of supporting entrepreneurship, we plan to apply for a patent and set up a startup company to promote our project. We designed </span>a complete business plan<span style="color: black;">For the project, this can be found in the attached file.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">First, </span><span style="color: black;"><strong>unmet needs and potential customers</strong></span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Virus-like particle VLPs is a revolutionary delivery system, which can be used to accurately prevent crop diseases and has many application scenarios. Antibody fragments that can be designed independently also provide products with more accurate targeting and richer disease resistance possibilities for different plants and diseases. We hope to cut into the track accurately, solve social pain points and create value for world agriculture. Therefore, we introduced the analysis of unmet needs and potential customers at the beginning of the business plan, which we think is very important for commercialization.</span></p><h1><strong>sUnmet needs and pain points:</strong></h1><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">According to FAO statistics, agricultural pests destroyed as many as 40% of the world's crops, causing losses as high as 220 billion dollars. We often use chemical pesticides to reduce this loss. China has 9% of cultivated land and uses 50%-60% of chemical pesticides in the world. Chemical pesticides have caused irreversible pollution to our soil, groundwater and ecological environment. Therefore, we often use less chemical pesticides to solve this problem. Reducing chemical pesticides is a three-pronged problem, which will lead to food disasters and threaten food security. How to solve this three-pronged problem?</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">According to our research, the current plant diseases and insect pests market mainly has the following problems:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(1) The traditional chemical, physical and biological insecticidal methods have the pain points of environmental pollution, limited scale and easy drug resistance. In view of these pain points, the plasmid-mediated RNA interference technology developed by our team can achieve the goal of green, efficient, large-scale application and not easy to produce drug resistance.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(2) dsRNA expressed in nuclear transgenic plant cells will be converted into short siRNA by Dicer. However, because long-chain dsRNA plays a role in COLEOPTERA, the traditional way to control COLEOPTERA is mass transfer, because there is no Dicer enzyme cleavage in chloroplasts, and the expressed dsRNA can exist stably. However, in the face of high-activity dsRNase in the intestinal tract of Lepidoptera, dsRNA cannot exist stably. We found that siRNA is more stable and effective than dsRNA, but the control effect is still not satisfactory.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24.1pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;"><strong>Corresponding solutions:</strong></span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Combined with the artificial seed project that we have been exposed to before, the seeds are coated with trehalose to provide protection, thus improving their germination rate. We have a new idea in the collision of thinking, that is, to wrap RNA with a layer of protein shell, so that it is not easy to be degraded.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">After consulting a lot of data, we know that virus-like particles VLPs are very safe, which are similar to virus particles in structure and can be passed through the same. Among them, MS2 VLP can effectively protect RNA from degradation like armor, and the efficiency of entering cells is higher after adding membrane-penetrating peptide.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">In the experiment, we fed the newly hatched Spodoptera litura larvae with transgenic strains. According to the experimental phenomena and data analysis, the following results were obtained. The pupation failure rate and deformity rate of Spodoptera litura fed with MS2-amiR-CHS1 bacteria are higher and more effective.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Second, market segmentation and customer analysis</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Divide the market based on rrop type. Different crops may have different requirements and usage habits of pesticides, and green pesticide companies can provide corresponding products and solutions according to crop types. Our target market is subdivided into tobacco, potato, eggplant, pepper, poplar and willow.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Divide the market by consumer type. According to the needs and preferences of different consumer groups, the target market is subdivided into individual small farmers and large-scale agricultural producers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">By subdividing the target market, green pesticide companies can better understand the needs and characteristics of different market segments, provide targeted products and solutions, enhance market competitiveness and meet the needs of consumers. At the same time, the company also needs to formulate corresponding marketing strategies, including pricing, channel selection, brand promotion and sales promotion, in order to achieve competitive advantage in the target market.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">The data of the third central agricultural census show that the number of small farmers accounts for more than 98% of the agricultural business entities. At the same time, according to the documents issued by the central government, we should focus on farmers' cooperatives and family farms. The target markets of new pesticides for guarding grain safety are individual small farmers, farmers' cooperatives and family farms.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">In the market positioning, according to the composition of the new pesticide, it is positioned as a non-chemical, efficient and green pesticide with good quality and low price, which caters to the economic level of small farmers' consumers.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Through marketing and product introduction, the new pesticide of Shouliangan will be shaped into an image of environmental protection, non-toxic and pollution-free, and can improve the soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">The market position of the new pesticide for Shouliangan is a biological pesticide which is cheap, green, non-toxic and pollution-free, and can improve the soil.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3.5 Operation mode</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Owing to the lack of large-scale production capacity of RNAi pesticide, this project mode adopts the sales mode of CSO sales and the production mode of CMO processing. The team plans to cooperate with the fermentation foundry to provide fermentation strains, fermentation broth formula and technical guidance to the foundry, which is responsible for strain culture and fermentation. This model can help you reduce production costs, save equipment investment and human resources, and focus on core technologies and market development. At the same time, the team entrusts external partners such as Zhisheng Yougu and Dabei Nong to be responsible for the sales and distribution of products. After the project matures, it will gradually apply for qualification to form the integration of R&amp;D, production and sales, develop and cultivate its own channels, and directly supply target customers to reduce the cost of intermediate circulation links and maximize profits.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">To achieve the goal of profit maximization, this project will realize the comprehensive profit of the project by cooperating with downstream enterprises to collect product technical guidance service fees, product sales fees, technology licensing fees, etc.</span></p><h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>technical feasibility, scalability and creativity</strong></h2><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">1. Technical feasibility</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">The unique advantages of plasmid-mediated RNA interference technology are:</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(1) </span><span style="color: black;"><strong>High copy and high expression</strong></span><span style="color: black;"> (because the chloroplast copy number is very high, for example, it can reach 10,000 genome copies in tobacco, so it has the potential of high expression of foreign genes).</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(2) </span><span style="color: black;"><strong>matrilineal inheritance</strong></span><span style="color: black;"> (there is no plastid in pollen, and foreign genes will not cause environmental safety problems with pollen diffusion)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(3) </span><span style="color: black;"><strong>Position effect</strong></span><span style="color: black;"> (compared with random nuclear insertion, chloroplast transformation is site-specific integration, so there is no position effect)</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">2. Market viability</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">According to the statistics of Phillips McDougall, a seed and pesticide consulting company under Agrow's parent company Informa, the global pesticide market sales in 2022 was 78.193 billion US dollars. Among them, the proportion of pesticides for crops is close to 90%, the market sales amount is 69.256 billion US dollars, and the CAGR is 5.0% in recent five years.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">In terms of regions, Asia-Pacific and Latin America are the largest and fastest growing regional markets. In 2022, the market sales in the Asia-Pacific region was 21.885 billion US dollars, accounting for 32%, and the CAGR was 6.1% in the past five years; Latin American market sales reached 19.137 billion US dollars, accounting for 28%, and CAGR was 8.6% in recent five years. It can be seen that the demand for pesticides in the Asia-Pacific region is also increasing year by year.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">From the global background, first, under the influence of the epidemic, international food trade was blocked, and energy, labor and sea freight rates rose sharply, triggering a global food crisis; Second, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the two major grain producers, has almost paralyzed production and supply, further aggravating the international community's concern about the instability of the global grain supply chain; Third, extreme weather such as drought and cold wave frequently occur, the output of major grain exporting countries in the world has declined, and export restrictions have been continuously introduced in panic, which has led to an increase in the world food gap; Fourth, during the epidemic, various economies generally implemented loose monetary policies, which led to rising inflation levels. As a result, food prices continued to rise, which led to a rebound in pesticide prices.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Therefore, the pesticide industry has entered a high boom cycle. The pesticide sales of the four multinational pesticide giants Syngenta, Bayer, BASF and Kedihua have increased rapidly, and the sales of the top 100 pesticide enterprises in China have increased, and the pesticide market is very good.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">China is a big agricultural country with frequent pests and diseases and relatively fragile agricultural ecological environment, and food security cannot be separated from the escort of pesticides. However, it is worth emphasizing that the excessive use of pesticides, the increase in production costs caused by unscientific application methods, the excessive residues of agricultural products, and environmental pollution are also worthy of attention. With the increasing awareness of environmental protection and food safety, countries have further strengthened their control over the pesticide industry. In recent years, many varieties with top market share, such as paraquat, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, chlorpyrifos, etc., have encountered the policy of prohibition and restriction in major consumer markets around the world.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Therefore, developing new pesticides with high efficiency, low toxicity and environmental protection, and upgrading products are the best way to deal with the risk of variety prohibition and restriction. The "Tenth Five-Year Plan" for the Development of National Pesticide Industry has taken the adjustment of product structure as one of the key tasks, and clearly put forward "supporting the development of new chemical pesticides with high efficiency and low risk, vigorously developing biological pesticides, gradually phasing out old pesticide varieties and formulations with strong resistance, poor efficacy and high risk, and strictly controlling high-toxic and high-risk pesticides and additives with environmental persistence and bioaccumulation".</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">2. Competition analysis</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(1) Chemical insecticidal method</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Using chemical pesticides to control agricultural pests is convenient, economical, efficient and quick. However, with the extensive use of chemical pesticides, it has caused serious environmental pollution. Chemical pesticides have great toxicity to many non-target organisms and caused irreparable damage to the entire ecosystem. In recent years, more and more chemical pesticides have been banned due to environmental pollution, biological residues, drug resistance and other problems caused by excessive use of pesticides.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(2) Physical insecticidal method</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">By trapping and killing with lights, trapping eggs with straw handles, trapping and killing with stick insect, trapping and other methods. Physical pest control is friendly to the environment, but the range of pest control is limited, the cost is too high, and the pest control effect is unstable, so it can not cope with the large-scale pest problem.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">(3) Biological insecticidal method</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">The application of Bt cotton, an insect-resistant plant, is environmentally friendly, with good insecticidal effect and high economic benefits. However, with the extension of use time, insects have developed drug resistance, and Bt protein has only an insect-resistant effect on some insects, and the expression level of Bt protein is easily affected by environmental factors.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;">3.1 Financial model</p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;">The initial investment capital was 8 million CNY, including 2 million CNY registered capital, and various research fundings (Table 1).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Table 1 </strong>Source table of initial investment funds</p><table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="111">Resource</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Project title</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">Funding (CNY)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="8" width="111">Natural Science Foundation of China</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Mechanism of the synergistic role of Pesudomonas in plastid-mediated RNA interference for pest control</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">540,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Molecular mechanism of refractoriness of Helicoverpa armigera to plastid-mediated RNA interference and management strategies</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">600,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">A study on stability and insecticidal activity of double-stranded RNAs expressed in transformed plastids</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">650,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Molecular mechanism and application of plastid-mediated RNA interference against Helicoverpa armigera enhanced by oxidative stress</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">580,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Mechanism and application of plant-mediated RNA interference against Helicoverpa armigera engineered with MS2 bacteriophage virus-like particle</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">540, 000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Synergistic mechanism of gutl bacteria in dsRNA-induced mortality of Plagiodera versicolora</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">690, 000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Mechanism of highly efficient delivery of plastid-produced insecticidal protein to enhance plant resistance to root-knot nematodes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">540,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Mechanism and application of plastid-mediated RNA interference against Myzus persicae</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">300,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="111">National Key Research and Development Program of China</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Application of RNA interference technology in forest pest control</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">1,470,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="2" width="111">Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Control of vegetable insects through plasmid-mediated RNA interference</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">500,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Study on plasmid-mediated RNA interference for pest insect management</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">200,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="111">Crosswise Project</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Potato plastid transformation, cooperated with Beijing DaBeinong Biotechnology Co., Ltd.</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">150,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="111">Registered Capital</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="369">Registered capital of the company</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">2,000,000</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1" width="480">Total</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" width="104">8,000,000</td></tr></tbody></table><p style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><p style="text-indent: 24pt; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: black;">Our project was derived from 2021 in Plastid Genetic Engineering laboratory in Hubei University.
