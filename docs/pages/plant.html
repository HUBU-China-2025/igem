To meet the food requirements of this rapidly growing population, especially in the context of uncertain climate change and diminishing arable land, it is essential to enhance food production while reducing inputs. Traditional plant breeding methods are often labor-intensive and time-consuming, whereas genetic engineering offers a promising approach to boost crop productivity.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Nuclear genome transformation has become a widely adopted technique in many economically important plant species. However, it comes with several limitations, such as unpredictable expression of the gene of interest and gene silencing due to the random integration of T-DNA. In addition to nuclear transformation, plants provide another avenue for genetic modification through the transformation of the small genomes of two DNA-containing cell organelles: plastids (chloroplasts) and mitochondria, which are derived from cyanobacteria and α-proteobacteria, respectively.</p><h3 style="text-align: start;">Advantages of Plastid Transformation</h3><p style="text-align: start;">Plastid genomes in higher plants are highly conserved, typically around 150 kb in size, and encode approximately 130 genes. These genomes are composed of four parts: a large single-copy region, a small single-copy region, and two inverted repeat regions. Compared to conventional nuclear genetic engineering, transforming the plastid genome offers several significant advantages:</p><ol><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Highly Precise Transgene Insertion</strong>: Efficient homologous recombination allows for precise and targeted insertion of transgenes into the plastid genome.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>High Levels of Protein Expression</strong>: The potential for expressing foreign proteins at extremely high levels, up to 75% of the total soluble protein, makes plastid transformation highly attractive for producing recombinant proteins.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Multigene Engineering</strong>: The ability to stack multiple transgenes in synthetic operons in a single transformation event facilitates the engineering of complex traits.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Absence of Epigenetic Effects</strong>: Plastid transformation avoids issues such as gene silencing and position effects, which are common in nuclear transformation.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Increased Biosafety</strong>: Since plastids are generally not transmitted through pollen in most crops, there is a reduced risk of transgene spread, enhancing biosafety.</li></ol><h3 style="text-align: start;">Applications of Plastid Transformation</h3><p style="text-align: start;">Given these advantages, plastid transformation has been used to engineer various economic and agronomic traits, including:</p><ul><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Production of Recombinant Proteins and Enzymes</strong>: Plastids can be used to produce pharmaceutical proteins and industrial enzymes.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Resistance to Biotic and Abiotic Stresses</strong>: Enhanced resistance against insect pests, viral, fungal, and bacterial diseases, as well as tolerance to abiotic stresses like salt, drought, and cold.</li><li style="text-align: start;"><strong>Herbicide Resistance</strong>: Improved resistance to herbicides, facilitating weed management.</li></ul><h3 style="text-align: start;">Historical Development and Current Status</h3><p style="text-align: start;">The first successful plastid transformation was achieved in <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em>, a unicellular green alga, followed by <em>Nicotiana tabacum</em> (tobacco), a dicotyledonous flowering plant. Since then, plastid transformation technology has been extended to over 20 species of flowering plants. However, reproducible protocols for achieving homoplastic offspring are currently limited to a few species, including tobacco, potato, tomato, cabbage, soybean, lettuce, poplar, and licorice weed.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Cereals, the world's most important food crops, have proven to be recalcitrant to chloroplast transformation. This is primarily due to the lack of suitable selectable systems, low shoot regeneration frequencies, and the absence of effective cis-elements for transgene expression in non-green plastids. Although plastid transformation in rice has been reported, no homoplasmic and fertile transplastomic rice lines have been obtained. Recently, a high-efficiency plastid transformation protocol for the model plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> has been developed. This protocol relies on a root-based selection and regeneration system, along with the use of <em>acc2</em> knockout lines, which significantly enhances the efficiency of plastid transformation.</p><p style="text-align: start;">In summary, the development of efficient and reliable <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12px; font-family: Verdana;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(255, 251, 143); background-color: rgb(38, 38, 38); font-size: 16px; font-family: Verdana;"><strong>HUBU-China's </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); background-color: rgb(254, 253, 248); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID</strong></span> transformation protocols in a wider range of plant species, including kiwifruit, holds great promise for addressing the challenges of global food security and advancing the field of plant synthetic biology.</p><h1 style="text-align: start;">Stable Plastid Transformation in Kiwifruit (Actinidia chinensis)</h1><h2 style="text-align: start;">Introduction</h2><p style="text-align: start;">Transformation of the plastid genome, also known as transplastomics, offers a number of advantages over conventional nuclear transformation, including extremely high levels of transgene expression, the absence of gene silencing, and the ability to stack multiple transgenes. This technology was first established in the unicellular alga <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em> and later in tobacco. Over the past three decades, it has been extended to more than 20 seed plants, but major crops such as rice, wheat, and maize have not yet been successfully transformed. Poplar is currently the only woody species that has been subjected to plastid transformation.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Kiwifruit (<em>Actinidia chinensis</em>) is a valuable crop with a high content of vitamin C and other beneficial metabolites. Although nuclear transformation in kiwifruit has been routine for several years, plastid transformation has not been reported until now. The development of a plastid transformation system in kiwifruit would enable efficient production of recombinant proteins, edible vaccines, and biopharmaceuticals, and provide a tool to study the complex inheritance patterns of plastids in this species.</p><p style="text-align: start;">In this work, <span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(207, 19, 34); font-size: 16px;">PESTI</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(212, 56, 13); font-size: 16px;">CIDES</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 44, 54); font-size: 16px;"><em>™</em></span> present an efficient protocol for the stable transformation of the plastid genome in kiwifruit, which includes the optimization of plant regeneration, selection, and DNA delivery methods, as well as the construction of a specific plastid transformation vector. The successful establishment of this protocol extends transplastomic technology to another woody species and opens up new possibilities for synthetic biology applications in kiwifruit.</p><h2 style="text-align: start;">Methods</h2><h3 style="text-align: start;">Optimization of Plant Regeneration and Selection System</h3><p style="text-align: start;">To develop an effective leaf-based regeneration and selection system, <span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(207, 19, 34); font-size: 16px;">PESTI</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(212, 56, 13); font-size: 16px;">CIDES</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 44, 54); font-size: 16px;"><em>™</em></span> tested various media compositions. The optimal medium, AcReM3, containing 1 mg L-1 thidiazuron (TDZ), 2 mg L-1 6-benzyladenine (6-BA), and 1 mg L-1 α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), was selected based on its ability to induce the maximum number of shoots from young leaf explants.</p><p style="text-align: start;">For the selection of plastid-transformed kiwifruit, the spectinomycin-resistance gene <em>aadA</em> was used as a selectable marker. The appropriate concentration for selection was determined by cultivating leaf explants on media supplemented with different concentrations of spectinomycin. A concentration of 300 mg L-1 spectinomycin was found to be effective in suppressing background growth while allowing the growth of transformants.</p><h3 style="text-align: start;">Construction of the Plastid Transformation Vector</h3><p style="text-align: start;">The plastid transformation vector, pQQC7, was constructed to carry both the <em>aadA</em> selectable marker and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. The <em>aadA</em> gene, under the control of the <em>psbA</em> promoter from <em>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</em>, confers resistance to spectinomycin. The GFP gene, driven by the 16S rRNA promoter from tobacco, serves as a visual marker for transformation. Both cassettes are flanked by kiwifruit-specific sequences to allow targeted insertion into the plastid genome between the <em>trnfM</em> and <em>trnG</em> genes.</p><h3 style="text-align: start;">Biolistic DNA Delivery and Selection of Transplastomic Plants</h3><p style="text-align: start;">Leaf explants were bombarded with the pQQC7 plasmid using optimized parameters, including a rupture disk pressure of 1100 psi and a target distance of 9 cm. After bombardment, the explants were placed on a selective medium containing 300 mg L-1 spectinomycin. Primary spectinomycin-resistant calli appeared after three months, and six independent transplastomic lines were obtained from 12 plates. These lines were further propagated and regenerated to achieve homoplasmy, and then transferred to soil.</p><h2 style="text-align: start;">Results</h2><h3 style="text-align: start;">Optimization of Plant Regeneration and Selection System for Kiwifruit</h3><p style="text-align: start;">To develop an efficient leaf-based regeneration and selection regime for kiwifruit, <span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(207, 19, 34); font-size: 16px;">PESTI</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(212, 56, 13); font-size: 16px;">CIDES</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 44, 54); font-size: 16px;"><em>™</em></span> first sought to identify the optimal medium composition for regeneration.

Seeds of the mature fruit were sterilized and inoculated on Murashige-Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962), containing 3% sucrose, 0.8% agar, and 0.5 mg/L gibberellin A<sub>3 </sub>(GA<sub>3</sub>). <em>In vitro</em> grown leaves of kiwifruit were used as the explants for plastid transformation. </p><h3><strong>GUS assay</strong> <strong>for optimization of biolistic DNA delivery parameters</strong></h3><p>To optimize the DNA delivery parameters, transient transformations were performed in which kiwifruit leaves were bombarded with a nuclear expression vector <em>(De Marchis et al., 2009; Sidorov et al., 1999)</em>, which carries a <em>GUS</em> gene under control of the CaMV <em>35S</em> promoter. For the GUS staining, the bombarded leaves were vacuum infiltrated for 5 min with freshly-prepared staining buffer (Jefferson, 1987). The stained samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C in dark and rinsed with 95% ethanol before taking photographs.</p><h3><strong>Construction of kiwifruit plastid transformation vectors</strong></h3><p>The<em> </em>reporter gene <em>GFP</em> and<em> </em>selective marker gene (<em>aadA</em>) cassettes of kiwifruit plastid transformation vector pYY34 derived from pYY11, which was similar with pYY12 except for a restriction enzyme site <em>(Wu et al., 2017)</em>. The pYY11 was produced by co-transforming the backbone of pYY12 digested by <em>Nco</em>I and <em>Xba</em>I and <em>GFP</em> fused with ~30-bp homology amplified with prime pair GFP-NcoI-F/GFP-NotI-R (Fig. 2A). </p><p>The pYY34 vector was generated by ligating four digested DNA fragments using T4 DNA ligase. These fragments included the backbone obtained by digesting pBluescripII KS(+) with <em>Sac</em>I and <em>Kpn</em>I, the <em>GFP</em> and<em> aadA</em> expression cassettes excised from pYY11 with <em>Sal</em>I and <em>Spe</em>I <em>(Wu et al., 2017)</em>, and the left homologous recombination region (LHRR, 1,092 bp) digested with <em>Kpn</em>I and <em>Sal</em>I and the right homologous recombination region (RHRR, 1,185 bp) digested with <em>Bln</em>I and <em>Sac</em>I. The corresponding flanking sequences for homologous recombination were obtained by PCR amplification from the kiwifruit chloroplast genome (NCBI access number: NC_026690.1) using primer pairs (KpnI)AcLHRR-F/(SalI)AcLHRR-R and (BlnI)AcRHRR-F/(SacI)AcRHRR-R, respectively. For the construction of pQQC7, the <em>Cr</em>P<em>psbA</em> and <em>aadA</em> fragments were PCR amplified using primer pairs (ApaI)CrPpsbA-F/(g10)CrPpsbA-R and (g10)aadA-F/(SphI)aadA, respectively, using pYY34 as the template. Subsequently, an overlap-extension PCR was performed to obtain a <em>Cr</em>P<em>psbA</em>-<em>aadA</em> fragment separated by the 5′ UTR from <em>gene10</em> of bacteriophage T7 (<em>T7g10</em>). Finally, both the <em>Cr</em>P<em>psbA</em>-<em>aadA</em> fragment and pYY34 were excised with <em>Apa</em>I/<em>Sph</em>I and ligated to generate the pQQC7 (NCBI access number: PP816932; plasmid number: 221601, Addgene; Fig. 2B).

Fig. 3B) overnight in the dark <em>(Maliga, 2012; Wu et al., 2019)</em>. Afterward, gold particles (0.6 μm diameter), coated with plasmid DNA pQQC7, were introduced into the plant cells by biolistic gun PDS-1000/He (BioRad, USA). Following the biolistic bombardment, the leaf samples were diced into 5 × 5 mm and were placed on AcReMs (agar-solid MS medium, 3% sucrose, and combinations of different hormones; Table S1) containing spectinomycin with abaxial side up (Fig. 3C). When the primary spectinomycin-resistant calli or shoots appeared, they were transferred to AcSmM (agar-solid MS medium supplemented with 3% sucrose, 2 mg/L 6-BA, 0.2 mg/L NAA, and 0.3 mg/L GA<sub>3</sub>) supplemented spectinomycin for further culture. The leaves of these lines were subjected to several additional rounds of regeneration for homoplasmy. The growth conditions for the whole selection procedure are 16 h light 20–25 μE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> at 25 °C and 8 h dark at 20 °C in a growth chamber. The r<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">egenerated shoots were then subcultured to 1/2 MS medium supplemented with </span>1 mg L<sup>−1</sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"> Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and spectinomycin to induce root formation</span>. Fi<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">nally, the shoots were transferred to soil and grown in standard greenhouse conditions.</span></p><h3><strong>DNA isolation, PCR and Southern blot analyses</strong></h3><p>Total plant DNA was isolated from leaf samples of wild-type and transplastomic kiwifruit plants using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide-based extraction method (Clarke, 2009). For PCR analysis, the total DNA of wild-type and transplastomic kiwifruit leaves were used as templates with two pairs of primers (GFP-F/GFP-R and psaB-aadA-F/psaB-aadA-R). The PCR results were detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For Southern blot analysis, DNA samples (7 μg total cellular DNA) were digested with BglII and were then separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and transferred onto a positively charged nylon membranes (GE Healthcare, USA) by capillary action using the semi-dry transfer method. A 643-bp fragment of the <em>psaB</em> gene was amplified by PCR from kiwifruit plastid DNA using primer pair AcpsaB probe-F/AcpsaB probe-R (Table 2) and used as hybridization probe to verify plastid transformation. Labeling of the probe and hybridization were performed with the DIG-High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II following the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Switzerland).</p><h3><strong>RNA isolation and northern blot analyses</strong></h3><p>Total RNA was isolated from fresh leaves using the Quick RNA isolation Kit (Huayueyang Biotechnology, China) and following the manufacturer’s instruction. RNA samples (2 µg total RNA) were denatured and separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gels. The separated RNA molecules were then transferred from the gel to a positively charged nylon membrane (GE Healthcare, USA) using standard blotting protocols. Gene-speciﬁc hybridization probes were prepared by PCR ampliﬁcation from transformation plasmid. PCR primers and their use are listed in Table S2. Hybridization probes were labeled with DIG using the PCR DIG probe synthesis kit following the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche, Switzerland). RNA blots were hybridized at 68 °C using standard protocols.</p><h3><strong>Protein extraction and western blot analyses</strong></h3><p>Total protein was isolated using a phenol-based extraction method <em>(Cahoon et al., 1992)</em>. Protein concentrations were measured with the Easy II Protein Quantitative Kit (TransGen Biotech, China). Samples of 2 µg of total leaf protein and a dilution series of GFP standard protein were separated by electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stain (Biyuntian Biotechnology, China) or blotted onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare, USA) using wet transfer for 1.5 h. Membranes were blocked with TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies against GFP (1:3000 dilution, ABclonal) for 1.5–2 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed with TBS-T (10 min, 3 times, at room temperature), stained with HRP conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000) for 1-1.5 h at room temperature, and again washed with TBS-T (10 min, 3 times, at room temperature). Detection was performed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Biosharp, China) kit and the AI600 imager (GE Healthcare, USA).</p><h3><strong>Detection of GFP fluorescence signal</strong></h3><p><strong> </strong>Subcellular localization of GFP fluorescence in leaves of wild-type and transplastomic plants was determined by confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM 980; Zeiss) using an argon laser for excitation (at 488 nm), a 491–654 nm filter for detection of GFP fluorescence and a 646–728 nm filter for detection of chlorophyll fluorescence. </p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(207, 19, 34); font-size: 16px;">PESTI</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(212, 56, 13); font-size: 16px;">CIDES</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 44, 54); font-size: 16px;"><em>™</em></span> thank all the members of <span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(207, 19, 34); font-size: 16px;">PESTI</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(212, 56, 13); font-size: 16px;">CIDES</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 44, 54); font-size: 16px;"><em>™</em></span> HUBU-China iGEM team for their contributions to this project. <span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"><strong>PLASTID </strong></span><span style="color: rgb(19, 82, 0); font-size: 16px;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(207, 19, 34); font-size: 16px;">PESTI</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(212, 56, 13); font-size: 16px;">CIDES</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 44, 54); font-size: 16px;"><em>™</em></span> also acknowledge the support of the Key Laboratory of Plant Germplasm Enhancement and Specialty Agriculture, Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the State Key Laboratory of Biocatalysis and Enzyme Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Hubei University.</p><h2>References</h2><ul><li>Boynton, J.E., et al.
